## Benchmark of edge-detection methods

Extension of the [conference paper](https://hal.science/hal-04995510/). Preparation of a package/framework to easily generate synthetic datasets based on a set of sparse PSD matrices. The proposed pipeline should help the diagnostic of existing methods when confronted to changing some parameters (signal to noise ratio , size of the data ...)

## Towards reliable graphs analysis: uncertainty quantification for fMRI data

We propose several exploitation of Inverse-Wishart model to infer the correlation matrix. For now we focus on the construction of credible region and its interpretation as a FWER control procedure, or as a way to evaluate the evolution of a patient.

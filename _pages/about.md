# Presentation

First year PhD Student in Grenoble. After a Master Degree in Statistics and Data Science, I started a PhD with Sophie Achard, Julyan Arbel and Guillaume Kom Kan King in the Statify team of Inria Grenoble.
My subject focus on graph inference and comparison for fMRI data using bayesian statistics. We are especially interested in quantifying uncertainty during graph analysis. 

# Interests
I am interested in application in neurosciences, biology and sociology. I focus on interpretability and robustness of models.
